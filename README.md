This code explains how to generate independent variables that tend to have a bimode or multimode distribution and a high correlation between features.Â 
Then, based on these independent variables, we can set the dependent variable. **In this case, let's try applying the idea of multinominal logistic regression to generate data simulation with three classes. **
